# 404 Gallery for Next.js

A **404 gallery** built with **TypeScript** for **Next.js** projects.  
This project provides multiple pre-made 404 pages (`page.tsx` files). To use one, simply rename it to `not-found.tsx` and place it in the same directory as your main `page.tsx`.

## Features

- Built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**
- Fully responsive
- Pre-made gallery pages for quick integration
- Open-source and free to use

## Usage

1. Browse `https://404.qclid.space` and choose a 404 page.
2. Find you're chosen 404 page as a `page.tsx` in this repository (App folder will have folders named after the 404 pages).
3. Download it and rename it to `not-found.tsx`.
4. Move it to where you're projects main `page.tsx` file is.
5. Start your Next.js project; the new 404 gallery will automatically appear on any 404 route.

Example:

```
/app
 ├─ page.tsx        # Your main page
 ├─ not-found.tsx   # Copied and renamed 404 gallery
```

## Customization

- Replace images or components inside the gallery as needed.
- Modify animations, layout, or effects directly in the `not-found.tsx`.
- Each page is independent, so you can swap them anytime.
